            <h2>The Many-Worlds Interpretation</h2>
            <p>Written by: Okabe Rintarou</p>
            <p>The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts that the universal wavefunction is the only fundamental entity and that there is no wavefunction collapse. This implies that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are physically realized in some "world" or universe.</p>

                    <p><strong>John Titor:</strong> This theory aligns closely with my experiences in time travel. Each decision spawns a new worldline, with countless worldlines existing in parallel.</p>

                    <p><strong>Makise Kurisu:</strong> While the MWI is fascinating, it's essential to approach it with skepticism. The lack of empirical evidence makes it hard to validate against other quantum interpretations.</p>

            <h2>Black Hole Information Paradox</h2>
            <p>Written by: Kurisu Makise</p>
            <p>The Black Hole Information Paradox is one of the most significant unresolved problems in theoretical physics. When particles are swallowed by a black hole, what happens to the information they contain? Some believe it's lost forever, while others think it may be emitted as Hawking radiation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement and Spooky Action at a Distance</h2>
            <p>Written by: Moeka Kiryu</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where the states of two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other particles. Einstein referred to it as "spooky action at a distance."</p>

            <h2>Time Dilation and Special Relativity</h2>
            <p>Written by: Suzuha Amane</p>
            <p>Time dilation is a difference in the elapsed time measured by two observers, due to a velocity difference between them, or to a difference in gravitational potential between their locations. It's a core concept in Einstein's theory of relativity.</p>
